"""
Using brute force algorithm, list out all possible moves and
always takes the best move. This algorithm is OK for this small
game since there are only limited amount of possibilities. But
when it comes to big game such as chess, it will take forever to
decide the next move.

Wiki:
In computer science, brute-force search or exhaustive search,
also known as generate and test, is a very general problem-solving
technique and algorithmic paradigm that consists of systematically
enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking
whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.
